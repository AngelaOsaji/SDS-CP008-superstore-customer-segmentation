# Welcome to the SuperDataScience Community Project!
Welcome to the Superstore Customer Segmentation repository! ðŸŽ‰

This project is a collaborative initiative brought to you by SuperDataScience, a thriving community dedicated to advancing the fields of data science, machine learning, and AI. We are excited to have you join us in this journey of learning, experimentation, and growth.

## About This Project
In this repository, youâ€™ll find the work carried out by our community members in completing an end-to-end machine learning project. Please note that the resources available here is not to be used or copied without referencing the appropriate authors.


## Project Objectives
By utilizing clustering algorithms, we aim to provide actionable insights into customer preferences and behavior patterns, which will ultimately drive more effective customer engagement and increase profitability.

**Understand Customer Behavior:** Identify key patterns in customer purchasing habits, such as frequency of purchases, total spend, product preferences, and discount sensitivity. 
**Create Customer Segments:** Group customers into distinct segments based on their transactional data (e.g., purchase history, frequency, order quantity, discount usage, and profitability).
**Analyze Customer Segments:** Understand the characteristics of each segment to tailor business strategies for different customer groups, such as high-value customers, occasional buyers, and discount-driven shoppers.
**Provide Strategic Recommendations:** Based on the segmentation results, suggest marketing, sales, and retention strategies to target each customer segment effectively.


## Business Questions to Answer
- Who are the high-value customers?
- Which customer groups are most likely to respond to discounts or promotional offers?
- How can we improve customer retention by segment?
- What are the differences in customer behavior by region or segment?
- How can we personalize marketing strategies for different segments?


## Project Phases
**Data Exploration & Preprocessing (Week 1)**
- Understand the dataset, clean the data, and prepare it for analysis.

**Modeling & Segmentation (Week 2)**
- Engineering new features (feature engineering) such as 
  - Segment by Geographic location
  - Segment by Purchase Behavior 
  - Segment by Customer lifetime value (CLV), average order value (AOV) (Optional)
- Apply clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN) to segment customers into distinct groups.

**Segment Analysis & Interpretation (Week 3)**
- Analyze each segmentâ€™s characteristics and behaviors to draw actionable insights. 
- For 3: High/M/Discount seekers

**Reporting & Recommendations (Week 4)**
- Create the final report and provide strategic recommendations for customer targeting (i.e. marketing campaigns)and retention strategies (i.e. upselling/cross selling)
